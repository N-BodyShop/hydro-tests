# Hydro Test Problems
This repository contains a collection of ICs (and the scripts to generate them)
for hydro test problems.  These are aimed for particle (Lagrangian) codes, though
we may add Eulerian ICs at some point as well.

### Onestar
This is a single star in a uniform, glassy box.  Useful for testing feedback models, blastwaves, and superbubbles.
